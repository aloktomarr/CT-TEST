Front End Developer Dynamic Skills Test by Alok Tomar for application of Font-end Developer at [Coalition Technologies](https://coalitiontechnologies.com/). 

I have tried to keep the code structured and semantically organized, ensuring a clear and logical layout for the Los Angeles website. The inclusion of comments throughout the code contributes to readability, providing developers with insights into the purpose of each section. 

Code exhibits a modular approach with functions organized to handle specific tasks. The utilization of arrays to store accordion buttons and corresponding collapse elements demonstrates a thoughtful data structure choice, enhancing the code's scalability. Event listeners are efficiently attached using a loop, minimizing redundancy and improving the overall structure. The JavaScript code successfully preserves the desired functionality, addressing specific requirements like ensuring one accordion closes when the other is open. 

Overall, the JavaScript code complements the HTML structure, providing a seamless and interactive user experience on the Los Angeles website.
